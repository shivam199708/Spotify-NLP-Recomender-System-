# Spotify NLP Recommender System
## Overview
The Spotify NLP Recommender System is an innovative project that enhances music recommendations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project leverages Spotify's dataset and advanced NLP methods to analyze textual data and provide personalized music recommendations to users. It combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning to create an efficient and intelligent recommendation system.

### Objective

1. The primary goal of this project is to build a recommender system that:

2. Processes textual data associated with music (e.g., lyrics, descriptions, or metadata).

3. Applies NLP techniques to extract meaningful features.

4. Enhances user experience by providing accurate and personalized recommendations.

### Features

1. Data Preprocessing: Handles raw Spotify data, including cleaning, tokenization, and removing irrelevant content.

2. Feature Engineering: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings to extract insights from textual data.

3. Machine Learning Models: Implements models for recommendation, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods.

4. Evaluation Metrics: Analyzes model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### Technologies Used

The project uses the following libraries and tools:

Programming Language: Python

NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy

Machine Learning Libraries: sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch

Data Manipulation: pandas, NumPy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

### Project Workflow

- Data Collection: Import the Spotify dataset and other relevant data.

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize text data.

- Tokenize and remove stop words.

- Apply stemming or lemmatization.

### Feature Engineering:

Extract features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.

Incorporate metadata for hybrid recommendations.

### Model Development:

Train machine learning models for recommendations.

Experiment with algorithms like collaborative filtering or neural networks.

### Evaluation:

Validate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Perform A/B testing for recommendation efficiency.

## Results

The project significantly improves recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction by incorporating textual data and NLP techniques. Detailed evaluation results can be found in the results/ directory.

### Future Work
